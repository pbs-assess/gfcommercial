# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Biological data collected from commercial fishing vessels are an important component of fisheries stock assessments. In Canadaâ€™s Pacific region, these data have been collected by dockside monitoring programs and independent, third-party at-sea observers aboard commercial bottom trawl vessels [@davis_evaluating_2008]. The at-sea observer program was launched in 1996, and required most commercial bottom trawl fishing vessels to fund and bring a third party observer aboard to record catch and collect specimen data. There was 100\% mandatory observer coverage for all vessels participating in the Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) groundfish trawl fishery under the Option A groundfish license. Bottom trawlers operating in the Strait of Georgia (Option B groundfish license) were excluded from this 100\% requirement, as were mid-water hake trawlers [@haigh_at-sea_2002]. The hook and line fleet (Pacific Halibut, Lingcod, rockfish, and North Pacific Spiny Dogfish) and the Sablefish trap fishery was also exempt from carrying at-sea observers 100\% of the time. Electronic Monitoring was introduced in these fisheries in 2006, but systems to collect biological samples have not been developed [@stanley_design_2015]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all at-sea observer programs were paused and have not been re-introduced, having a profound effect on the volume and type of data received from commercial fishing vessels [@dfo_groundfish_2023].

The groundfish commercial bio-sampling report was developed to provide an overview of data collection and availability from 1996-2022 for major BC groundfish species of commercial and conservation interest. We also note that not all of the available data is used. For example, sorted specimen data, from high graded specimens, is often not used in stock assessments, and not all age structures collected are aged. This report can guide decisions on future monitoring programs, data collection, and resource allocation. The data are presented at a coastwide scale, and also by finer, Groundfish Management Areas (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)) so that the spatial, as well as temporal, trends can be assessed. 

The groundfish commercial bio-sampling report was modelled after the groundfish (GF) data synopsis [@dfo_data_2022]. Generation is automated-pulling data from government databases (e.g., GFBio and GFFOS), generating visualizations, and stitching the document together. The figures are displayed by species and follow standardized layouts, similar to the GF data synopsis report. The main figures of the report are presented in three-page, species-by-species subsections that visually synthesize the available commercial data for each species. The report covers 29 groundfish species that have commercial catch quota. However, quota species with little to no data were not included because the lack of data is already illustrated in the GF data synopsis [@dfo_data_2022].  

The goals of the report were to (1) display available data acquired from commercial fishing vessels, and (2) perform a basic qualitative analysis of the temporal and spatial trends of the data by species. 

Each set of pages for a single species is laid out in the same format. The page layout begins with the species common name, the species scientific name, the DFO species code, which usually corresponds to the page number referencing the species in @hart1988, the species Order and Family, links to the species FishBase and WoRMS pages, citations for the last Research Document, Last Science Advisory Report, and COSEWIC Status Report (if available), and the species COSEWIC and SARA status (if listed). All of the figures display the data separated by Pacific Marine Commission (PMFC) areas and year (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)). The figures are laid out such that the first page has a plot containing all the numbers, the sorted and unsorted commercial specimen counts. The second page has figures pertaining to the amount of catch and specimens collected and how representative the collected specimens are across space and time. Page three contains age and length frequency data. Detailed figure captions are included in Section \@ref(sec:plot-descriptions).
