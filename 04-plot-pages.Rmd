Arrowtooth Flounder were caught mostly by bottom trawl. The bulk of the catch came from Areas 5D, 5B, and 3D. Areas 5C and 4B had negligible catch. The largest catch occurred in 2005, but the greatest number of specimens were collected in 2001. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2020, with gaps occurring from 2010-2015. Unsorted specimen collection ended in 2017, missing only 1997. When totaled across areas, the specimen collection was relatively representative. Many age structures were collected, but only 25\% or fewer were aged. Weight data were limited and stopped in 2017. Length data were abundant, and mostly sexed.

Big Skate were caught mostly by bottom trawl, but some midwater trawl and hook and line. The catch and specimens mostly came from Areas 5D and 5B. The other areas had little, if negligible, catch. The largest catch and specimen collection occurred in 2003, both of which have since been steadily declining. Both sorted and unsorted specimen collection began in 2001. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2016, with gaps from 2006-2009 and 2013-2015. Unsorted specimen collection was consistent until ending in 2015. There were no age or weight data, and the length data were mostly unsexed.

Bocaccio were caught by bottom and midwater trawl. The catch and specimens mostly came from Areas 5B, 5A, 3D, and 3C. The other areas had negligible catch. There have been no reported trawl landings of Bocaccio from the Strait of Georgia since 1983. Any catch in 4B after 1983 came from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait) and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) [@cosewic2002bocaccio]. The largest catch occurred in 2022, while specimen collection peaked in 1999, 2004, and 2019. Data collection was inconsistent across time and space. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1996-2020, with many years missing. Unsorted specimen collection occurred from 2004-2020, but missed 2012 and 2016-2019. The specimens collected were not very representative of the catch, most specimens came from one collection event a year. Almost all age structures collected were aged, and most lengths were from sexed individuals. Weight data were very limited.

Unsorted specimen collection was consistent until ending in 2015. Data were most representative in Area 5D and from 1997-2007. The bulk of ages were from sorted specimens and ended in 2006, and specimen weights were often not collected. Length data were mostly sexed.

Lingcod were caught by bottom trawl and hook and line. The catch amounts were greatest in Areas 5B, 5A, 3D, and 3C. Catch in Area 4B was very low and would have only come from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait)  and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) as the commercial fishery in the Strait of Georgia has been closed since 1990 [@holt2016lingSOG]. Catch from the hook and line fishery remained relatively consistent over time, but the trawl fishery catch has slowly decreased since 2000. Specimen collection peaked in 2002, then drastically decreased. Area 5B had the highest volume of collected specimens. Specimens were collected exclusively from bottom trawl until 2010, after which they were collected exclusively from hook and line. Sorted specimen collection was consistent until ending in 2010. Unsorted specimen collection was limited from 1996-2004 for Areas 5D-3C, after which it only occurred in Area 4B from 2013-2021. The data were representative only when totaled across all areas and from 1998-2004. All age data, except one year (1996), were from sorted specimens. Weight data were collected from sorted specimens from 2002-2010, and unsorted specimens from 2013-2021. Length data were mostly unsexed and from unsorted specimens.

Longspine Thornyhead were caught mostly by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection followed a similar trajectory. They peaked around 2000, then steadily decreased until 2004 after which levels remained low. Both Catch and specimen collection were most abundant in Area 3D.  Catch was negligible in Areas 5D, 5C, and 4B. Sorted specimen collection occurred until 2018, with several gaps from 2004-2015. Unsorted specimen collection was consistent from 1997-2018, only missing 2016. The data were fairly representative of the catch in Areas 5E, 3D, and 3C. When totaled across all areas, the data were representative from 1998-2015. The 1996 age data is not plotted because the species category code is unknown (Anderson et al., 2019). Weight data were only collected in 2001. Most of the length data were sexed.

Redbanded Rockfish were caught equally by bottom trawl and hook and line. The area with the most catch and specimens collected was Area 5B. Catch peaked in 2001, and slowly decreased until 2007, then remained stable. Catch was negligible in Area 4B. Specimen collection was limited. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1997-2009 and in 2015. Unsorted specimen collection and inconsistent from 1996-2013. The data were not representative of the catch. Age, weight, and length data were all limited. Length data were mostly sexed, but the majority came from sorted individuals.

Redstripe Rockfish were caught by bottom and midwater trawl. Catch and specimens mostly came from Areas 5B, 5A, 3D, and 3C. Catch was negligible in Areas 5D and 4B. Catch gradually decreased after 2000. Specimen collection peaked in 1998, then quickly decreased. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2020, with a gap from 2012-2014. Unsorted specimen collection was consistent until ending in 2018. When totaled across all areas, the data were fairly representative of the catch from 1996-2015. Many age structures were collected, of which about 30\% were aged. Weight data were limited, especially from unsorted specimens. Length data were abundant and mostly sexed.

Note that Sablefish undergoes directed annual trap surveys,
      which are used for stock assessment and are not included in
      this report. The most recent stock assessment should be
      consulted for details on stock status.

Sablefish were caught mostly by trap, but also by hook and line and some bottom and midwater trawl. The majority of catch and specimens came from Area 5E. Catch has remained relatively stable through time, with minor peaks in 1999 and 2005-2006. Catch in Area 4B was negligible. Specimen collection peaked in 1999, then quickly decreased. Sorted specimen collection was inconsistent, ending in 2020, with large gaps from 2003-2015. Unsorted specimen collection occurred until 2022, with a gap from 2019-2021. Totaled across all areas, the data were fairly representative of the data from 1998-2011. Age, weight, and length data were abundant and mostly from unsorted specimens.

Shortracker Rockfish were caught mostly by hook and line and bottom trawl. Areas 5E and 3D had the largest catch, though catches were low across all areas due to low abundance. Catch remained relatively stable across time, with only minor fluctuations. Specimen collection was extremely limited and infrequent, occurring in Areas 5E, 3D, 3C, and 4B. The data were not representative of the catch. There were no age data. Length and weight data were limited, and mostly from sorted specimens.

Shortspine Thornyhead were mostly caught by bottom trawl. Catch mostly occurred in Areas 5E and 3D. Catch slowly declined after 1999. Catch in Area 4B was negligible. Specimen collection peak from 1998-2000, then decreased suddenly. Sorted specimen collection occurred until 2019, with gaps from 2007-2015. Unsorted specimen collection occurred from 1997-2016. Totaled across all areas, the data were representative of the catch from 1998-2006. Age structures were often collected, but only one year were aged. The 1996 age data is not plotted because the species category code is unknown (Anderson et al., 2019). Weight data were extremely lacking. Length data were abundant, but many were unsexed.
