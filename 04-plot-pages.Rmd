Last Research Document: @grandin2017arrowtooth\
Last Science Advisory Report: @dfo2015arrowtooth\
Arrowtooth flounder has no data from Area 4B and very little from 5E and 5C, but the other areas are decently covered. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2020, with a few years missing, and unsorted specimen collection ended in 2017. Age structures were collected from every fishing event, but only a quarter or less of them were analyzed. The largest commercial catch occurred in 2005, almost exclusively from bottom trawl. Across all years, the most catch came from Area 3D. The greatest number of commercial specimens were collected in 2001. Overall, the specimen data collection is relatively representative, occurring multiple times throughout the year. All age samples after 2016 and length samples after 2017 are from sorted specimens.

We have very limited data on Big skate. The majority of data comes from Areas 5D and 5B and is only length data, mostly unsexed. There was no data collected in Areas 5E, 3D, or 4B. There was no data collected after 2016. Big skate is mostly caught in bottom trawl, but sometimes in hook and line. The largest catch and specimen collection occurred in 2003, both of which have been in a steady decline since then.

The largest specimen collection year was 2004, but 1999 and 2019 were also big years. The specimens collected are not very representative of the catch, most specimens came from one collection event a year. The majority of length data came from sexed individuals.

Canary rockfish has good data coverage. There was a gap in sorted specimen collection from 2010-2015, but unsorted specimens were well sampled in those years. Sorted specimen collection stopped in 2020, but unsorted stopped in 2018. Almost all age structures collected, were analyzed. Canary rockfish catch has remained consistent over the years, coming mostly from bottom trawl in 3D. Specimen collection was high from 1998-2001, but was significantly lower in other years.

Dover sole sorted specimens were fairly consistent until 2019, except for a break from 2010-2015. Unsorted specimen collection was consistent until 2015. Only about half of the age structures collected, were analyzed. Dover sole was mostly found in Areas 5D and 3C, and was almost  exclusively caught by bottom trawl. Catch amounts were mostly consistent, but have been slowly decreasing since 2003. The largest specimen collection years were 1998-1999, and decreased significantly since then. Specimen collection was fairly representative until 2011, then decreased due to the lack of samples.

There is limited unsorted specimen data from 1996-2004 in Areas 5D-3C, then excellent unsorted specimen data from 2013-present in area 4B onlyÂ . Age structures have been almost exclusively analyzed for sorted specimens only. Lingcod catch has been historically caught by equal parts bottom trawl and hook and line. However, since 2000 the bottom trawl catch has been slowly decreasing. Lingcod specimens were exclusively collected from bottom trawl samples until 2010, then hook and line from 2013 onward. Lingcod specimen collection was representative of the catch, especially in recent years in Area 4B. Lingcod length frequency data was mostly unsexed and often from unsorted specimens.

Sorted specimen data for Longspine thornyhead has large gaps in it, but the unsorted specimen data is consistent. Both stopped being collected in 2018. Age structures were often collected; however, they were only analyzed in 1996 from sorted specimens. Commercial catch and specimen collection follow a similar trajectory, peaking around 2000, then suddenly decreasing. The majority of catch and specimens are from Area 3D and by bottom trawl. Overall, the specimens were representative of the catch. The 1996 age data is not plotted because the species category code is unknown (Anderson et al., 2019).

Both sorted and unsorted data for the North Pacific spiny dogfish are relatively consistent, with just a few years missing.

North Pacific spiny dogfish are mostly caught by hook and line, but a small portion are caught on bottom and midwater trawls. On average, commercial catch of North Pacific spiny dogfish was been declining since 2004. From 1996- 2001, commercial specimens were mostly collected from midwater trawl, after which hook and line and bottom trawl became the more common gear types for collection. The length frequency data was about half unsexed and unsorted.

[WoRMS](http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=159463)\
Last Research Document: @cox2019sablefish\

Last Science Response: @dfo2020sablefish\
Note that Sablefish undergoes directed annual trap surveys,
      which are used for
 stock assessment and are not included in
      this report. The most recent
 stock assessment should be
      consulted for details on stock status.
Sablefish has extensive unsorted data until 2018, except for Areas 5D, 5C, and 4B. Sablefish is caught by all gear types, but mostly by trap. Commercial specimens peaked in 1999, then significantly declined. The majority of the 1999 data came from discarded (sorted) specimens. With the exception of a few years, the data is fairly representative of the catch.

Last Science Advisory Report: @dfo1999shortraker\
Shortraker rockfish is one of our most poorly sampled species. We have extremely limited sorted or unsorted data. Shortraker is mostly caught by hook and line, but bottom trawl is also common. Catch has remained stable over time. The bulk of catch comes from Area 5E. The data is not representative of the catch.

Last Science Advisory Report: @dfo2016shortspineidiots\
Shortspine thornyhead sorted specimens stopped being collected in 2019, with several gaps. Unsorted specimens were consistently collected from 1997-2016. Age structures were often collected, but were only analyzed one year. Those ages are not displayed in the age frequency plot because the sample source code is unknown (Anderson et al., 2019). The most common gear type used to catch Shortspine thornyhead was bottom trawl, but midwater trawl and hook and line were also used. The bulk of catch came from Areas 5E and 3D. There were large collections of specimens from 1998-2000. The specimen collection was fairly representative of the catch from 1998-2005.

Silvergray rockfish sorted specimens were consistent until 2009, then after a few missing years, ended in 2019. Unsorted specimens were consistent until 2017. Age structures stopped being analyzed in 2011. No data from 4B. Commercial catch is mostly by bottom trawl, but some midwater trawl and hook and line. Catch has remained stable through time. Commercial specimen collection was highest in 2001, and has since decreased. Both catch and specimen collection occurred in all areas except Area 4B. The specimen collection is relatively representative until 2013.

Southern rock sole sorted specimens were consistent from 1996-2009, then resumed for 2016-2018. Unsorted specimens were consistent from 1998-2014, except for one year (2008). Commercial catch and specimen collection was most common in Areas 5D, 5C, 5B, and 5A. Southern rock sole is mostly caught by bottom trawl, but a very small amount was caught by midwater trawl. Commercial catch has been slowly declining since 2003, and commercial specimen collection significantly decreased after 2000. The specimen collection was representative of the catch from 1998-2007.

Walleye pollock sorted specimens were collected until 2020, with several years missing. Unsorted specimen collection was consistent, but ended in 2018. Age structures were collected, of which none were analyzed. Commercial catch and specimen collection was greatest in Areas 5D and 4B. Walleye pollock is caught by midwater trawl, but is found in bottom trawl on occasion. Commercial catch has increased to present day, while commercial specimen collection has fluctuated over time. The specimen collection is often not representative of the catch.

Yelloweye rockfish have consistent sorted specimen data until 2008. Unsorted specimen data for Yelloweye rockfish is very limited, occurring only in 1996, 1998-2000, and 2010.

The specimen collection is not representative of the catch, with the exception of a few years.
