COSEWIC Status: Special Concern



Pacific Spiny Dogfish were caught mostly by hook and line, but were also caught by bottom and midwater trawl. They were caught more commonly in the southern regions (Areas 3CD and 4B). The catch peaked in 2004, then declined on average until 2014, with minor peaks in 2007 and 2009. Increased hook and line catches in the early 2000s could be due to an effort transfer from the salmon fishery with the introduction of the Pacific Fisheries Adjustment and Restructuring (PFAR) program of the late 1990s [@dfo2012dogfish]. Specimen collection was highest in Area 3C and peaked in 1998. Unsorted specimen collection occurred from 1996 to 2016, lacking data in 2005, 2007, and 2008. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1996 to 2019, lacking data in 1997, 2012, and 2015. Roughly a third of the unsorted specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling matched cumulative total catch in a few years (2012--2014) with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 35,449 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 320 (<1%) had age structures, but none have been aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 21,934 (62%) were sexed, but none had weights. Since there were no age data to plot, the age frequency plot was replaced by a second length-frequency plot for fork lengths.

COSEWIC Status Report: @cosewic2007annualrep



Big Skate were caught mostly by bottom trawl, and occasionally by midwater trawl and hook and line. The catch and specimen collection mainly occurred in Areas 5D and 5B. The other areas had little, if any, catch. The largest catch and specimen collection occurred in 2003, both of which have since generally declined. The increased sampling in 2003 was due to a tagging project conducted with industry [@king2010bigskate]. Unsorted specimens were collected annually from 2001 to 2015. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 2001 to 2016, with gaps from 2006 to 2009 and 2013 to 2015. All unsorted specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched during roughly half of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2002 to 2005. Area 5B had the most representative sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 6,850 unsorted specimens were collected, and none had age structures. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 58 (<1%) were sexed, and none had weights.

Longnose Skate were caught mostly by bottom trawl and hook and line, and occasionally by midwater trawl. Longnose Skate was caught in all areas, but the catch was slightly higher in Area 3C. Specimen collection was sparse and from bottom trawl only. All specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling did not match cumulative total catch in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 175 unsorted specimens were collected, but none had age structures. All unsorted specimens had lengths, but none were sexed or had weights.

Pacific Cod were caught mostly by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection were highest in Area 5D. Total catch fluctuated over the years, peaking in 1997, 2005, and 2010. Specimen collection similarly peaked in 1998, 2004, and 2010. Unsorted specimens were collected annually from 1996 to 2017. Sorted specimens were collected annually from 1996 to 2014 and from 2016 to 2019. Most unsorted specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2002 to 2015. Between 1996 and 2022, 122,475 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 394 (<1%) had age structures, and 25 (<1% of specimens; 6% of age structures) have been aged. Both otolith and fin ray ageing methods for Pacific Cod are considered challenging [@chilton1982age], so age structures were rarely collected or aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 1,758 (1%) were sexed, while 1,024 (<1%) had weights.

Last joint Canada-US stock assessment: @johnson2025hake



Pacific Hake were caught mostly by midwater trawl. The catch and specimen collection were highest in Area 3C up to 2015, after which the catch was higher in Area 3D in some years. Total catch fluctuated over time, peaking around 1996--1999, 2004, and 2018--2020. Total specimen collection has fluctuated but declined on average since 1996. Unsorted specimens were collected annually over the 27-year time period of this study. Sorted specimen collection occurred in all years except 2014 and 2015. Approximately 16% of the unsorted specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched for most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2005 to 2015. Between 1996 and 2022, 519,976 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 137,233 (26%) had age structures, and 24,854 (5% of specimens; 18% of age structures) have been aged. The SCL regularly ages commercial hake otoliths for the annual stock assessment work done jointly by DFO and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 506,759 (97%) were sexed, while 22,621 (4%) had weights.

Last Science Advisory Report: @dfo2025yellowtail



Yellowtail Rockfish were caught mostly by bottom and midwater trawl. Catch and specimen collection was highest in Area 3D. The catch remained stable over time. Specimen collection peaked in 1999, quickly decreased until 2004, and then remained low. Unsorted specimens were collected annually from 1996 to 2018. Sorted specimens were collected from 1996 to 2013 and from 2016 to 2018. Roughly half of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched in roughly half of the years with biological sampling, especially 2002--2015. Between 1996 and 2022, 30,351 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 22,807 (75%) had age structures, and 9,685 (32% of specimens; 42% of age structures) have been aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 23,421 (77%) were sexed, while 1,447 (5%) had weights.

Shortspine Thornyhead were caught mostly by bottom trawl, and occasionally by hook and line and midwater trawl. Areas 5E and 3D had marginally higher catch. Catch trended downward from 1999 to 2022, on average. Specimen collection peaked from 1998 to 2000, then decreased suddenly. Unsorted specimens were collected annually from 1997 to 2016. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1996 to 2006, in 2009 and 2012, and from 2016 to 2019. All of the unsorted specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling profiles tended to match cumulative total catch profiles in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 28,299 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 9,653 (34%) had age structures, but none have been aged. Challenges in ageing otoliths, as often encountered for deep-sea species and confirmed by the SCL on research specimens, led to the choice not to age commercial otoliths [@starr2015shortspineidiots; @dfo2016shortspineidiots]. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 9,249 (33%) were sexed, while none had weights. The dominant length type was total length, but fork length measurements were also collected. We replaced the age frequency plot with a second length-frequency plot for fork lengths.

Longspine Thornyhead were caught mostly by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection were highest in Area 3D. Catch peaked in 1999, while specimen collection peaked in 2001; both have declined since, on average. Unsorted specimens were collected annually from 1997 to 2015 and from 2017 to 2018. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1996 to 2018, with several large gaps from 2004 to 2015. The abundance of specimens collected in the early 2000s was due to the implementation of an exploratory fishery, requiring biological samples from commercial tows [@schnute2004thornyhead]. All unsorted specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2000 to 2012. Between 1996 and 2022, 198,013 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 34,488 (17%) had age structures, but none have been aged. Challenges in ageing otoliths, as often encountered for deep-sea species and confirmed by the SCL on research specimens, led to the choice not to age commercial otoliths [@starr2000longspineTH; @starr2001longspineTH]. All unsorted specimens had lengths, and of these, 29,916 (15%) were sexed, while 50 (<1%) had weights. The dominant length type was total length, but fork length measurements were also collected.

Lingcod were caught mostly by bottom trawl, hook and line, and occasionally by midwater trawl. The catch was slightly higher in Areas 5AB and 3CD. Catch in Area 4B was low and would have only come from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait)  and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-area-map)) as the commercial fishery in the Strait of Georgia has been closed since 1990 [@holt2016lingSOG]. Catch from the hook and line fishery remained relatively consistent from 2001 to 2022. The trawl fishery catch decreased from 2008 to 2020 but slightly increased from 2021 to 2022. Specimen collection was variable from 2000 to 2004 and remained low from 2005 onward. Unsorted specimen collection occurred only in 1996 and 1998--2004. Sorted specimens were collected annually from 1996 to 2010. Nearly all unsorted specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling poorly matched the cumulative total catch in all years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 3,191 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 208 (7%) had age structures, and 50 (2% of specimens; 24% of age structures) have been aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 233 (7%) were sexed, and none had weights.

Arrowtooth Flounder were caught mostly by bottom trawl. The catch was marginally higher in Areas 5D, 5B, and 3D. The largest catch occurred in 2005, but the largest specimen collection occurred in 2001. Unsorted specimen collection occurred in 1996 and annually from 1998 to 2017. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1997 to 2020, but lacked data from 2010 to 2015. Nearly all unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched in most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2001 to 2015, but excluding 2008. Between 1996 and 2022, 35,256 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 17,447 (50%) had age structures, and 3,098 (9% of specimens; 18% of age structures) had been aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 18,470 (52%) were sexed, while 340 (1%) had weights.

Petrale Sole were caught mostly by bottom trawl. The catch was marginally higher in Area 3C. The catch slowly increased until 2011, slowly decreased until 2020, then increased again until 2022. Specimen collection peaked in 1999, then decreased until 2003, after which it remained low. Unsorted specimen collection occurred from 1998 to 2015, lacking data in 2000. Sorted specimen collection occurred annually from 1996 to 2009 and from 2016 to 2017. Nearly all of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling roughly matched cumulative total catch in a few years (2010--2012) with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 3,578 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 2,435 (68%) had age structures, and 1,186 (33% of specimens; 49% of age structures) have been aged.

## Pacific Halibut {#sec:pacific-halibut}

\emph{Hippoglossus stenolepis} (614)\
Order: Pleuronectiformes, Family: Pleuronectidae, 
[FishBase](http://www.fishbase.org/summary/Hippoglossus-stenolepis), 
[WoRMS](http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=274290)
\
IPHC Stock Assessment: @iphc2025



Pacific Halibut were caught mostly by hook and line. The catch was slightly higher in the northern areas, occurring fairly evenly across Areas 5BCDE. The catch peaked in 2006, declined until 2009, and has since remained relatively constant. Specimen collection peaked in 2002 and mostly came from discarded specimens. The bottom trawl fleet is not permitted to retain Pacific Halibut, but must measure them for quota management. Since all Halibut caught by trawl are discarded, regardless of size, we considered them as unsorted in Figures 3 (representativeness), 4 (age compositions), and 5 (length compositions). Sorted specimens were collected in 1997 and annually from 1999 to 2020, while unsorted specimen collection was limited. All specimens had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling (unsorted and bottom trawl discards) and catch profiles matched in all years with biological sampling except 1997 and 2020. Between 1996 and 2022, 399,640 specimens (unsorted and bottom trawl discards) were collected, and of these, 1 (<1%) had age structures, but none have been aged. All specimens (unsorted and bottom trawl discards) had lengths; of these, 140 (<1%) were sexed, while 399,369 (99.9%) had weights (mostly derived from a length-weight table).
