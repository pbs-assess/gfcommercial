COSEWIC Status: Special Concern



Pacific Spiny Dogfish were primarily caught by hook and line but occasionally by bottom and midwater trawl. The majority of the catch came from Areas 3CD and 4B. The catch peaked in 2004, then declined until 2014, and has since remained low. Specimen collection was highest in Area 3C and peaked in 1998. Unsorted specimen collection ended in 2016 and was missing in 2005, 2007, and 2008. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2019 and was missing in 1997, 2012, and 2015. Roughly half of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Most of the samples that lacked spatial coordinates were collected in Areas 4B and 3C from 2009 to 2013 and 1996 to 2001, respectively. Cumulative total sampling tended to be variable relative to cumulative total catch in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 35449 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 320 (1%) had age structures, but none were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 21934 (62%) were sexed, but none had weights. Since there were no age data to plot, we replaced the age frequency plot with a second length-frequency plot for fork lengths.

Big Skate were primarily caught by bottom trawl, but some were caught by midwater trawl and hook and line. The catch and specimen collection mainly occurred in Areas 5D and 5B. The other areas had little, if any, catch. The largest catch and specimen collection occurred in 2003, both of which have since steadily declined. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently from 2001 to 2015. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 2001 to 2016, with gaps from 2006 to 2009 and 2013 to 2015. All unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched during roughly half of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2002 to 2005. Area 5B had the most representative sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 6850 unsorted specimens were collected, and none had age structures. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 58 (1%) were sexed, and none had weights.

Longnose Skate were mostly caught by bottom trawl and hook and line. The catch was slightly higher in Area 3C than in the other areas. Specimen collection was sparse and from bottom trawl only. Specimens were only collected in Areas 5D, 5B, and 3CD. Half of the specimens were unsorted, and the other half were sorted. All unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling tended to lead cumulative total catch in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 175 unsorted specimens were collected, but none had age structures. All unsorted specimens had lengths, but none were sexed or had weights.

Pacific Cod were caught mostly by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection was highest in Area 5D. Areas 5E and 4B had very little catch. Total catch fluctuated over the years, peaking in 1997, 2005, and 2010. Specimen collection similarly peaked in 1998, 2004, and 2010. No specimens were collected from Area 4B. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently until 2017. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2019, missing only 2015. All unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2002 to 2015. Between 1996 and 2022, 122475 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 394 (<1%) had age structures, and 25 (<1% of specimens; 6% of age structures) were aged. Ageing methods for Pacific Cod have so far been deemed unreliable [@chilton1982age], so they were rarely collected and only aged one year. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 1758 (1%) were sexed, while 1024 (1%) had weights. However, the current Pacific Cod assessment relies heavily on a commercial mean-weight index.

Last joint Canada-US stock assessment: @grandin2024hake


Note that Pacific Hake undergoes a directed joint
      Canada-US coastwide survey and annual assessment. The most recent stock
      assessment should be consulted for details on stock status.

Pacific Hake were caught mostly by midwater trawl. The catch and specimen collection was highest in Area 3C. Total catch fluctuated over time, peaking around 1996, 2004, and 2018. Except for 2004, total specimen collection has decreased since 1996. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently over the 27 years. Sorted specimen collection occurred in all years except 2014 and 2015. Very few of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2004 to 2015. Between 1996 and 2022, 520246 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 137503 (26%) had age structures, and 25081 (5% of specimens; 18% of age structures) were aged. The SCL ages commercial otoliths regularly for the annual stock assessment work done jointly by DFO and NOAA. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 507029 (97%) were sexed, while 22891 (4%) had weights.

Walleye Pollock were mostly caught by midwater trawl and occasionally by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection mainly occurred in Areas 5D, 3C, and 4B. Catch has been trending upward since 1998. Specimen collection peaked in 1996, 2001, and 2020. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently until 2018. Sorted specimen collection occurred until 2020, with several gaps from 2008 to 2015. Roughly half of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Most samples lacking spatial coordinates were collected in Areas 3C and 4B. Cumulative total sampling profiles tended to match or be variable relative to cumulative total catch profiles in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 20960 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 12759 (61%) had age structures, but none were aged due to unreliable ages in survey samples [@starr2021pollock]. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 16447 (78%) were sexed, while 1275 (6%) had weights. Weight data were limited; however, the stock assessment delay-difference model relies on a mean-weight index.

COSEWIC Status: Threatened



Quillback Rockfish were caught mostly by hook and line. Catch was highest in Area 4B. Commercial catch was highest in 1996, then decreased until 2002, after which it remained stable. Specimen collection was highest in Area 4B and peaked in 2001. Unsorted and sorted specimen collection was limited and inconsistent ending in 2015 and 2008, respectively. Very few of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Most of the samples that included spatial coordinates were collected in 2001, 2003, 2009, and 2015. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles did not match, which is consistent with low sampling representativeness. Between 1996 and 2022, 2347 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 1349 (57%) had age structures, and 868 (37% of specimens; 64% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 1523 (65%) were sexed, while 1688 (72%) had weights.

Bocaccio were caught by bottom and midwater trawl and occasionally by hook and line. The catch and specimen collection mainly occurred in Areas 5AB and 3CD. Area 4B had negligible catch. There have been no reported trawl landings of Bocaccio from the Strait of Georgia since 1983. Any catch in 4B came from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait) and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) (Figure \@ref(fig: minor-area-map)) [@cosewic2002bocaccio]. The largest catch occurred in 2022, while specimen collection peaked in 1999, 2004, and 2019. Unsorted specimen collection occurred from 2004 to 2020 but had gaps in 2012 and 2016 to 2019. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1996 to 2020 but had several gaps. Nearly all unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. All samples lacking spatial coordinates were collected in Area 3D in 2010. Cumulative total sampling tended to lead cumulative total catch in most years with biological samples. Between 1996 and 2022, 1493 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 1407 (94%) had age structures, and 1206 (81% of specimens; 86% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 1378 (92%) were sexed, while 76 (5%) had weights.

Shortspine Thornyhead were primarily caught by bottom trawl, but some were caught by hook and line and midwater trawl. Areas 5E and 3D had the highest catch. Catch has been trending downward since 1999. The catch in Area 4B was negligible. Specimen collection peaked from 1998 to 2000, then decreased suddenly. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently from 1997 to 2016. Sorted specimen collection occurred until 2019, with several gaps from 2007 to 2015. All of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling profiles tended to match or lead cumulative total catch profiles in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 28299 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 9653 (34%) had age structures, but none were aged. Challenges in ageing otoliths, as often encountered for deep-sea species and confirmed by the SCL on research specimens, led to the choice not to age commercial otoliths. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 9249 (33%) were sexed, while none had weights. The dominant length type was total length, but fork length measurements were also collected. We replaced the age frequency plot with a second length-frequency plot for fork lengths.

Note that Sablefish undergoes directed annual trap surveys,
      which are used for stock assessment. The most recent stock assessment should be
      consulted for details on stock status.

Sablefish were caught mostly by trap and hook and line, with a small portion caught by bottom and midwater trawl. Area 5E had the highest catch and specimen collection. Catch peaked in 1999 and 2005 and has been increasing again since 2014. The catch in Area 4B was negligible. Specimen collection peaked in 1999, then decreased suddenly. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently until 2022 and are ongoing. Sorted specimen collection was inconsistent, ending in 2020, with large gaps from 2003 to 2015. Roughly half of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Most samples lacking spatial coordinates were collected between 2013 and 2022. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched in most of the years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 56907 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 38792 (68%) had age structures, and 8895 (16% of specimens; 23% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 46193 (81%) were sexed, while 33368 (59%) had weights. Unsorted specimen samples were historically abundant, but sample sizes have been low recently, especially from the hook and line and trawl fisheries. The sampling method differed among gear types. Trawl catch was sampled as part of the ASOP (1996--2020). Trap and hook and line fisheries have been sampled by a voluntary commercial catch sampling program since 1995 [@haist2001sablefish]. Under the voluntary program, samples are collected and frozen at sea by a fishing crew and brought back to shore for biological sampling. Before 2018, samples of whole fish were frozen. Starting in 2018, a head-only sampling program was initiated [@lacko2023sablefish_head].

Lingcod were caught by bottom trawl, hook and line, and occasionally by midwater trawl. The catch was slightly higher in Areas 5AB and 3CD. Catch in Area 4B was low and would have only come from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait)  and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) (Figure \@ref(fig: minor-area-map)) as the commercial fishery in the Strait of Georgia has been closed since 1990 [@holt2016lingSOG]. Catch from the hook and line fishery remained relatively consistent from 2001 to 2022. The trawl fishery catch decreased from 2004 to 2020 but slightly increased from 2021 to 2022. Specimen collection was variable from 2000 to 2004 and remained low from 2005 onward. Nearly all specimens were collected from the bottom trawl fishery. Unsorted specimen collection occurred only from 1996 to 2004, missing 1997. Sorted specimens were collected consistently until 2010. Nearly all unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. All samples lacking spatial coordinates were collected in Area 5A in 1996. Cumulative total sampling tended to be variable relative to the cumulative total catch in all years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 3844 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 545 (14%) had age structures, and 108 (3% of specimens; 20% of age structures) were aged.

All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 2511 (70%) were sexed, while 658 (18%) had weights.

IPHC Stock Assessment: @iphc2023


Note that Pacific Halibut undergoes thorough assessment by the
      International Pacific Halibut Commission based on the annual
      standardized setline survey. The most recent stock assessment
      should be consulted for details on stock status.

Pacific Halibut were caught mostly by hook and line. The catch mainly occurred in the northern areas. The catch in Area 4B was low and would have only come from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait) and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) (Figure \@ref(fig: minor-area-map)). The catch peaked in 2006 and has since slowly decreased. Specimen collection peaked in 2002 and mostly came from 'discarded' specimens. The bottom trawl fleet is not allowed to retain Pacific Halibut, but must measure them for quota management. Sorted specimens were collected consistently from 1999 to 2020, while unsorted specimen collection was limited.  Sampling was reduced starting in 2020 when the ASOP stopped sampling on bottom trawl vessels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very few of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. All the samples with spatial coordinates were collected in Area 5E in 2003. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles did not match in the years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 208 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 1 (<1%) had age structures, but none were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 64 (31%) were sexed, while 142 (68%) had weights.

Southern Rock Sole were mostly caught by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection mainly occurred in Areas 5ABCD. Catch was highest in 2003, then declined until 2008. Specimen collection peaked in 2000, then declined until 2008, and remained low thereafter. Unsorted specimen collection occurred from 1998 to 2014, missing only 2008. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2018, with a gap from 2010 to 2015. Nearly all of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Most samples lacking spatial coordinates were collected between 2010 and 2011. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched during most years with biological sampling, particularly from 2002 to 2007. Between 1996 and 2022, 27649 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 8849 (32%) had age structures, and 3469 (13% of specimens; 39% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 8845 (32%) were sexed, while 386 (1%) had weights.

Dover Sole were caught mostly by bottom trawl. The catch and specimen collection mainly occurred in Areas 5D and 3C. The catch in 4B was low. The total catch peaked in 2002 and then decreased until 2010. The specimen collection increased suddenly in 1998, then decreased quickly after 1999. The unsorted specimens were collected consistently until 2015. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2019, with a large gap from 2010 to 2015. Nearly all unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. The samples that lacked spatial coordinates were collected in 1996, 2010, 2011, and 2013. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched in most years with biological samples, particularly from 1999 to 2006. Areas 5D and 3C had the most representative sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 19927 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 8612 (43%) had age structures, and 2517 (13% of specimens; 29% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 8991 (45%) were sexed, while 709 (4%) had weights.
