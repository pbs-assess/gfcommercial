# Results {#sec:synopsis-plots}

This section contains the species-by-species data visualizations. Each
species is shown on four pages with similar layout used throughout. See
the previous 'Plot descriptions' section for detailed figure captions. In addition
to the figures, we also provide the scientific name, taxonomic details, DFO
species code [commonly the page number in @hart1988], a link to the FishBase and WoRMS (World
Register of Marine Species) web pages, details of the most recent DFO Research
Documents and Science Advisory Reports, and information related to
designations by the COSEWIC and to listings under the SARA. We also provide 
a short narrative of the major trends apparent for each species.The species are
ordered according to DFO species codes. Section \@ref(sec:common-name-index) provides links to the 
pages sorted alphabetically by common name.
