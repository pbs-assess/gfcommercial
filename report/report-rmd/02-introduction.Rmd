# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Biological specimen data collected from commercial fishing catches are an important component of fisheries stock assessments. In Canada’s Pacific groundfish fisheries, biological data have been collected by the At-Sea Observer Program (ASOP), dockside monitoring programs, and special projects [@davis_evaluating_2008].

Canada’s Pacific commercial groundfish fisheries comprise seven distinct commercial sector groups: Groundfish Trawl, Halibut, Sablefish, Inside Rockfish, Outside Rockfish, Lingcod, and Dogfish [@dfo2023ifmp]. These sectors vary by gear type, licensing, and management [@davis_evaluating_2008; @dfo2019licensing; @dfo2023ifmp]. Groundfish trawl vessels may fish under an Option “A” or “B” groundfish trawl license. Option “A” groundfish trawl vessels are permitted to mid-water trawl coastwide and bottom trawl in all areas except Area 4B. Option “B” groundfish trawl vessels are permitted to bottom trawl only and are restricted to Area 4B [@dfo2019licensing]. The other six sectors are licensed separately; gear types include longline, trap, troll, and handline. Since fisheries integration in 2006, these sectors have allowed for the reallocation of quota between vessels and fisheries to accommodate bycatch of non-target species [@dfo2006ifmp]. 

The ASOP began in 1996 and was operated by Archipelago Marine Research Ltd (AMR) under contract with the fisheries industry. Under this program, most commercial bottom trawl fishing vessels were required to fund a trained, independent, third-party on-board observer to record catch and collect biological specimen data [@dfo1996trawl]. From 1996 to 2019, bottom trawl vessels participating under license Option “A” were subject to 100% mandatory observer coverage for all vessels. Option “A” vessels mid-water trawling for Pacific Hake were excluded from this requirement but implemented a partial coverage observer program beginning in 2002 [@dfo1996trawl; @dfo2002ifmp]. From 1996 to 2006, Option “B” bottom trawl vessels were subject to partial observer coverage (~5-10%), but from 2007 to 2019, they were subject to 100% mandatory observer coverage [@dfo2007ifmp]. The six-line fishery sectors were also exempt from carrying at-sea observers 100% of the time. Electronic Monitoring was introduced in these fisheries in 2006, but except for Sablefish, systems to collect biological samples at sea have not been developed [@stanley_design_2015]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ASOP was paused and has not been re-introduced, profoundly affecting the type and quantity of data collected from commercial fisheries [@dfo2023ifmp]. Since 2020, commercial samples have been collected for only two species: Pacific Hake and Sablefish. 

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) dockside monitoring programs and special projects also collected biological data from commercial fisheries. Dockside biological sampling of the Pacific groundfish fisheries has occurred since the late 1950s. Annual reports of these data were published from 1970 to 1985 [@hamer_inventory_1986]. Dockside sampling occurred in Prince Rupert and Vancouver until 2010 and 2017, respectively. Commercial data were also collected during special projects for a few groundfish species. These special projects  were studies completed jointly by DFO with industry participation. For example, two special projects on Yelloweye Rockfish took place in 1997 and 1998 [@kronlund_yelloweye_2001; @yamanaka2000YE]. Data from special projects are also available from before 1996. For example, a study on two Pacific Ocean Perch stocks occurred from 1980 to 1993 [@leaman_experimental_1993].

This report was developed to provide an overview of available biological data collected on commercial groundfish fishing vessels from 1996 to 2022 for major BC groundfish species of commercial and conservation interest. The use of data and timing of data processing vary by data type. Stock assessments commonly use specimen data from unsorted samples, while sorted specimen data are used more rarely. In this report, 'specimen' refers to an individual fish or a measurement from an individual fish, while 'sample' refers to a collection of specimens. Samples are classified as 'unsorted' or 'sorted' depending on how the specimens were selected relative to the total catch. Unsorted samples correspond to a random or total collection from the full catch. By contrast, sorted samples correspond to a selective collection or a collection from a selected portion of the catch. Consequently, unsorted samples are valued as more closely approximating unbiased random samples of catch, while sorted samples are treated carefully due to expected sampling bias.

Biological data from sorted samples were more commonly used in stock assessments before the mid-1990s. However, some recent rockfish stock assessments have determined a negligible difference in the size distribution between unsorted and sorted samples and have combined the two [@starr2023canary; @starr2022bocaccio; @starr2022yellowmouth]. Future stock assessments could also use a stock assessment software platform to estimate a retention curve and treat unsorted, retained, and discarded specimens separately [e.g., @taylor2023petrale]. Ageing requests usually occur as needed rather than when specimen age structures are collected to support ageing prioritization at the Sclerochronology Lab (SCL). This report can guide decisions on future monitoring programs, data collection, and resource allocation. The data are presented by year at a coastwide scale and also by finer Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) areas (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)) so that spatial and temporal trends can be identified. 

The groundfish commercial biosampling report was modelled after the groundfish data synopsis [@anderson2019synopsis; @anderson2020synopsis; @dfo_data_2022]. The process for creating the report is automated so that it can be updated periodically and reproducibly. The process pulls data from government databases to generate figures before assembling the report. The figures are displayed by species and follow standardized layouts, similar to the groundfish data synopsis report. The main figures of the report are presented in four-page, species-by-species subsections that visually synthesize the available commercial data for each species. The report covers 29 groundfish species that have commercial catch quota. However, quota species with little to no data (i.e., China Rockfish (*Sebastes nebulosus*), Copper Rockfish (*Sebastes caurinus*), and Tiger Rockfish (*Sebastes nigrocinctus*)) are not included because the lack of data is already illustrated in the groundfish data synopsis [@dfo_data_2022].

The data are pulled from Groundfish databases using the R package [gfdata](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfdata) from pbs-asses on GitHub [@anderson2019synopsis; @gfdata]. The commercial catch data are pulled from the table `GF_MERGED_CATCH` in the GFFOS database using the `gfdata::get_catch()` function. The commercial specimen data are pulled from tables in the GFBioSQL database using the `gfdata::get_commercial_samples()` function. 

Each set of pages for a single species is laid out in the same format. The page layout begins with the species common name, the species scientific name, the DFO species code, which usually corresponds to the page number referencing the species in @hart1988, the species Order and Family, links to the species FishBase and WoRMS pages, citations for the last Research Document, Last Science Advisory Report, COSEWIC^[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada] Status Report (if available), and the species COSEWIC and SARA^[*Species at Risk Act*] status (if applicable). The figures display the data separated by PMFC areas and year (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)). The figures are laid out such that the first page shows the amount of catch and number of specimens. The second page compares counts of unsorted and sorted commercial specimens. The third page illustrates the temporal representativeness of sampling. The fourth page shows age and length frequency data. Detailed figure captions are included in Section \@ref(sec:plot-descriptions).
