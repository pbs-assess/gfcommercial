# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Biological specimen data collected from commercial fishing catches are an important component of fisheries stock assessments. In Canada’s Pacific groundfish fisheries, biological data have been collected by the At-Sea Observer Program (ASOP), dockside sampling programs, and special projects [@davis_evaluating_2008]. Biological specimen data are also collected from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) research surveys and other non-commercial programs (e.g., the International Pacific Halibut Commission Fishery-Independent Setline Survey - IPHC FISS), but these data and programs are outside the scope of this project. For the most recent data synopsis of research surveys, see @anderson2024synopsis.

Canada’s Pacific commercial groundfish fisheries comprise seven distinct commercial sector groups: Groundfish Trawl^[Includes the Pacific Hake midwater trawl fishery (domestic freezer trawler and shoreside, observed Joint-Venture, and foreign-excluding US)], Halibut, Sablefish, Inside Rockfish, Outside Rockfish, Lingcod, and Dogfish [@dfo2024ifmp]. These sectors vary by gear type, licensing, and management [@davis_evaluating_2008; @dfo2019licensing; @dfo2024ifmp]. Groundfish trawl vessels may fish under an Option “A” or “B” groundfish trawl license. Option “A” groundfish trawl vessels are permitted to mid-water trawl coastwide and bottom trawl in all areas except Area 4B. Option “B” groundfish trawl vessels are permitted to bottom trawl only and are restricted to Area 4B [@dfo2019licensing; @dfo2024ifmp]. The other six sectors are licensed separately; gear types include longline, trap, troll, and handline. Since fisheries integration in 2006, these sectors have allowed for the reallocation of quota between vessels and fisheries to accommodate catch of non-target species [@dfo2006ifmp].

Biological data are collected at several stages of sampling and processing. A *sample* typically includes all or part of the catch in a fishing set. Individual fish in the sample are called *specimens*, which are commonly measured for length and weight, assessed for sex and maturity status, and dissected to remove and store age structures. Age structures are processed into age data by request and usually proceed as needed for stock assessments to conserve limited resources at the Sclerochronology Lab (SCL). In some cases, specimens also have tissue samples collected for genetic analysis.

The ASOP began in 1996 and was operated by Archipelago Marine Research Ltd (AMR). Originally under contract with DFO and the commercial groundfish fishing industry, the industry took over the full cost of the program in 2012. Under this program, most commercial bottom trawl fishing vessels were required to fund a trained, independent on-board observer to maintain an independent fishing log, record catch and discards, and collect biological specimen data [@dfo1996trawl]. Biological specimen data collected by the ASOP could include specimen length, sex, maturity status, and age structure extraction. Weights were not collected at-sea.

From 1996 to 2019, bottom trawl vessels participating under license Option “A” were subject to mandatory 100% observer coverage for all vessels. Option “A” vessels mid-water trawling for Pacific Hake, and in some years Walleye Pollock, were initially excluded from this requirement; however, partial coverage by the ASOP was required beginning in 2002 [@dfo1996trawl; @dfo2002ifmp]. From 1996 to 2006, Option “B” bottom trawl vessels were subject to partial observer coverage (~5-10% of total sea days), but from 2007 to 2019, they were subject to 100% observer coverage [@dfo2007ifmp]. The six line fishery sectors were also initially exempt from carrying at-sea observers 100% of the time, although the partial coverage requirements rose from 1% to up to 20% of sea days, fleet dependent, between 2000 and 2005. In 2006, 100% observer coverage was required for vessels in the hook and line sectors, but this could be met by way of either an at-sea observer or the use of an electric monitoring (EM) system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ASOP was paused and has not been reintroduced. The resulting shift to strictly EM has profoundly affected the type and quantity of data collected from commercial fisheries [@dfo2024ifmp].

Electronic Monitoring was introduced in the line fisheries in 2006. EM systems include CCTV cameras, a control centre, GPS, winch and hydraulic sensors, and provide visual footage of retention or discarding of all fish [@stanley_design_2015]. Due to the difficulty of identifying rockfish species in imagery, and given that most rockfish die during capture, 100% retention of rockfish was required for identification by the dockside monitoring program (DMP). In addition to fisher log books and the DMP, EM provides a means of auditing fish caught, retained and discarded, by trip and set. EM can also be used to audit spatial data and the timing of gear deployment or retrieval. However, except for Sablefish^[Sablefish trap and hook and line fisheries have been sampled by a voluntary commercial catch sampling program since 1995 [@haist2001sablefish]. Under the voluntary program, samples are collected and frozen at sea by a fishing crew and brought back to shore for biological sampling. Before 2018, samples of whole fish were frozen. Starting in 2018, a head-only sampling program was initiated [@lacko2023sablefish_head]. More details in Section \@ref(sec:discussion).], systems to collect biological samples at sea have not been developed [@stanley_design_2015].

DFO dockside sampling programs and special projects also collected biological specimen data from commercial fisheries. Biological specimen data collected by dockside sampling could include specimen length, weight, sex, maturity status, and age structure extraction. Dockside biological sampling of the Pacific groundfish fisheries has occurred since the late 1950s. Annual reports of these data were published from 1970 to 1985 [@hamer_inventory_1986]. Dockside sampling occurred in Prince Rupert and Vancouver until 2010 and 2017, respectively. A pilot project to collect dockside biological samples from the trawl fishery began in 2023, but those data are not included in this report. Note that the dockside sampling program is separate from the DMP, which validates catch landing weights [@dfo2024ifmp].

Commercial data were also collected during special projects for a few groundfish species. These special projects were studies completed jointly by DFO with industry participation. For example, two special projects on Yelloweye Rockfish took place in 1997 and 1998 [@kronlund_yelloweye_2001; @yamanaka2000YE]. Data from special projects are also available from before 1996. For example, a study on two Pacific Ocean Perch stocks occurred from 1980 to 1993 [@leaman_experimental_1993].

This report was developed to provide an overview of available biological specimen data collected on commercial groundfish fishing vessels from 1996 to 2022 for major BC groundfish species with commercial catch quota and conservation interest. While biological data are available before 1996, we focus on this time period with the aim of supporting decision-making around future commercial sampling programs and, in particular, sampling to replace the ASOP that began in 1996. We only reported on species with commercial catch quota because these species are commercially important and require biological data for stock assessment and management purposes. The data are presented by year at a coastwide scale and also by finer Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) areas (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)) so that spatial and temporal trends can be identified. A thorough review of the sampling programs is out of the scope of this project.

How a sample of fish is collected from a fishing set can influence how the specimen data are used. Unsorted samples correspond to a random or total collection from the full catch. By contrast, sorted samples correspond to a selective collection or a collection from a selected portion of the catch (e.g., a sample from the retained fish only). Consequently, unsorted samples are valued as more closely approximating unbiased random samples of catch, while sorted samples may need to be modelled to account for expected sampling bias.

Biological data demands have changed over time to support changing assessment and research needs. While specimen data from sorted samples were commonly used in stock assessments before the mid-1990s, unsorted aged specimen data are more commonly sought for integrated age-structured assessments now. Spatially explicit latitude and longitude records are increasingly needed for spatiotemporal standardization of composition data and research on spatial patterns in body condition and growth [@lindmark2023spatiotemporal; @frid2016spatial]. Efforts have been made to improve data quality to meet changing needs [@dfo1996trawl, @dfo2006ifmp] and to reevaluate lesser-used data from the past. Several recent rockfish assessments have made use of sorted data after determining a negligible difference in size distribution between unsorted and sorted samples in some cases [@starr2023canary; @starr2022bocaccio; @starr2022yellowmouth], and other assessments have used retention curves to reconcile differences where they occur [@taylor2023petrale].

The groundfish commercial biosampling report was modelled after the groundfish data synopsis [@anderson2019synopsis; @anderson2024synopsis]. The process for creating the report is automated so that it can be updated periodically and reproducibly. The process pulls data from government databases to generate figures before assembling the report. The figures are displayed by species and follow standardized layouts, similar to the groundfish data synopsis report. The main figures of this report are presented in four-page, species-by-species subsections that visually synthesize the available commercial data for each species. The report covers 29 groundfish species that have commercial catch quota. However, three quota species---China Rockfish (*Sebastes nebulosus*), Copper Rockfish (*Sebastes caurinus*), and Tiger Rockfish (*Sebastes nigrocinctus*)---had little to no data. Consequently, they were not included because the lack of data is already illustrated in the groundfish data synopsis [@anderson2024synopsis].

The data are pulled from Groundfish databases using the R package [gfdata](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfdata) [@anderson2019synopsis; @gfdata]. The commercial catch data are pulled from the table `GF_MERGED_CATCH` in the GFFOS database using the `gfdata::get_catch()` function. The commercial specimen data are pulled from tables in the GFBioSQL database using the `gfdata::get_commercial_samples()` function. Details of the data extraction process can be found in Appendix \@ref(app:data).

Each set of pages for a single species is laid out in the same format. The page layout begins with details and relevant publications about the species. The figures are laid out such that the first page shows the amount of catch and number of specimens. The second page compares counts of unsorted and sorted commercial specimens. The third page illustrates the temporal representativeness of sampling. The fourth page shows age and length frequency data. Detailed figure captions are included in Section \@ref(sec:plot-descriptions). The figures display the data separated by PMFC areas and year (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)). The details on the figures are small and intended to be viewed on screen under magnification rather than in a printed format.
