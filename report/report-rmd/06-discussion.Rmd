# Discussion

In this report, we summarized the available data collected from commercial fishing vessels by At-Sea Observers and Dockside Samplers from 1996 to 2022 for 29 groundfish species found in British Columbia. We presented the data for each species over four pages. The first page displayed the commercial catch and specimen collection for each year and area. The second page summarized the type and quantity of data we had for that species. The third page indicated how representative the data were compared to the catch. The fourth page plotted the age and length frequency data, separated by sex, for each year and PMFC area. 

Of the 29 species included in this report, the Pacific Hake had the best data coverage over time and space. Pacific Hake was only missing two years of sorted specimen data, and every area contained at least some, if not abundant, data. Pacific Ocean Perch also had near complete data coverage. Other species that had strong data coverage were Arrowtooth Flounder and Yellowtail Rockfish. Some species, like Pacific Halibut, had consistent data across space and time, but the data were almost exclusively from sorted specimens. No species had data from every year in every area.

Longnose Skate and Shortraker Rockfish were the two most poorly sampled species in this report, with only seven or eight sampling events in only four or three areas over the 27 years, respectively. Big Skate and Yelloweye Rockfish were also poorly sampled. Yelloweye Rockfish were primarily caught by the hook-and-line fleet, where biological sampling programs to complement the Electronic Monitoring have not yet been developed. Most commercial samples that do exist are a result of special projects undertaken jointly by DFO Science and the fisheries industry. 

Sampling ended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic for most species in this report. However, for many species, unsorted data collection stopped before 2019. On average, sorted flatfish sampling ended between 2017 and 2019, and unsorted sampling ended in 2015. Most rockfish continued to be sampled until 2020, but unsorted sampling stopped in 2018 or earlier for some species. Round fish, such as Pacific Hake and Pacific Cod, had the most consistent data coverage across time. Many species also exhibited a gap in sorted specimen collection in the late 2000s to early 2010s, lasting 1--7 years. If this gap occurred, the collection of unsorted specimens usually increased during that  time .

The number of collected specimens was often related to the magnitude of the catch. Most species had little to no biological data collected in Area 4B, but these species were either not found or had fishing closures in the Strait of Georgia. If these species did have a small amount of catch or specimens collected in Area 4B, they usually came from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait) and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-area-map)). The few species with a high quantity of catch and specimens collected from Area 4B were Pacific Hake, Pacific Spiny Dogfish, Quillback Rockfish, and Walleye Pollock. These species were caught and sampled throughout Area 4B. English Sole was also caught in high quantities throughout Area 4B, but since 1996, only one sample of specimens has been collected in minor area 12. In addition, for most species, the best specimen collection across all areas occurred pre-2005, likely by dockside monitoring. In the case of rockfishes, this trend could be linked to the reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) of some inshore stocks of up to 75% between 2002 and 2005 [@davis_evaluating_2008]. Similarly, representativeness tended to be higher when more samples were collected. Often, if sampling was not representative at the area level, it was representative when totalled across all areas. 

Only two species have had commercial samples collected since the termination of the ASOP in 2020: Pacific Hake and Sablefish. AMR port samplers collected Pacific Hake samples from the landed catch of electronically monitored shoreside trips [@grandin2024hake]. Pacific Hake samples were not collected from freezer trawlers between 2020-2021; however, since 2022, samples were collected by fishing crew from two tows per trip and delivered to AMR port samples as frozen specimens [@grandin2024hake]. Sablefish were sampled by a voluntary commercial catch head-only sampling program [@haist2001sablefish; @lacko2023sablefish_head]. In the head-only sampling program, samples are collected by the fishing crew and delivered as frozen head samples to DFO staff.

Weight data from individual fish are important in some stock assessments, including Pacific Cod and Walleye Pollock, which rely heavily on commercial mean-weight indices; however, weight data were lacking for most species. If weights were collected, they were mainly collected from sorted specimens in the 2000s, likely by dockside monitoring due to a lack of scales at sea. Weights are challenging to measure at sea because scales generally rely on an immobile base to infer mass from the force imposed by gravity. At sea, additional forces due to ship motion often frustrate accurate weight measurement. Where weights were collected, they were generally measured on shore (dockside) from sorted specimens between 2000 and 2010. Surprisingly, sexed length data were also often missing for species easily sexed externally (i.e., sharks and skates).

Stock assessment and research data needs continue to change as data analysis methods and fishery patterns change. Sorted specimens that provided adequate data for earlier assessment models have been used less in recent years, while the need for unsorted specimens, especially ageing data, to condition more sophisticated statistical models has grown. Despite the common need for ageing data, fewer than half the collected commercial age structures have been analyzed on average. Despite a continued need for unsorted specimen data that preserves the latitude and longitude of catch, commercial specimen collection declined markedly between the early 2000s and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, from which it has yet to recover. This report summarized the commercial biological sampling data for 29 groundfish species over 27 years, including data types and trends. We hope this information helps inform future commercial sampling decisions for groundfish in British Columbia.
