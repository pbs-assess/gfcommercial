# Discussion

In this report, we summarized the available data collected from commercial fishing vessels by port samplers or at-sea observers from 1996 to 2022 for 29 groundfish species that are found off the coast of British Columbia. We presented the data for each species over 3 pages. The first page summarized the amounts and types of data that we have for that species. Page two displayed the commercial catch and specimen collection for each year and area, and how representative the data were compared to the catch (e.g., did the specimen collections occur when the catch occurred?). The third page plotted the age and length frequency data, separated by sex, for each year and area. 

Of the 29 species included in this report, Pacific Hake (*Merluccius productus*) had the best data coverage over time and space. Pacific Hake was only missing two years of sorted specimen data, and every area contained at least some, if not abundant, data. No species had complete data coverage (i.e., data from every year in every area). Pacific Ocean Perch (*Sebastes alutus*) also had near complete data coverage. Other species that had good data coverage were Arrowtooth Flounder (*Atheresthes stomias*) and Yellowtail Rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*). Some species had very consistent data across space and time, but the data were almost exclusively from sorted specimens (e.g., Pacific Halibut, *Hippoglossus stenolepis*).

Longnose Skate (*Raja rhina*) and Shortracker Rockfish (*Sebastes borealis*) were the two most poorly sampled species, with only 7 or 8 fishing event’s worth of data covering only 4 or 3 areas over the 27-year period, respectively. Big Skate (*Beringraja binoculata*) and Yelloweye Rockfish (*Sebastes ruberrimus*) were also poorly sampled. Yelloweye Rockfish were primarily caught by the hook and line fleet and biological sampling programs to complement the Electronic Monitoring had not yet been developed.

Of the species included in this report, most species stopped being sampled in 2019-2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, for many species, unsorted data collection stopped before this time. On average, flatfish sorted sampling ended in 2017-2019, and unsorted sampling ended in 2015. Most rockfish continued to be sampled until 2020, but unsorted sampling stopped 2018 or earlier for some species. Round fish, such as Pacific Hake and Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*), had the most consistent coverage of data across time. Many species also exhibited a gap in sorted specimen collection in the late 2000’s and early 2010’s, lasting 1-7 years. If this gap occurred, usually unsorted specimen collection increased during that time. 

The volume of collected specimens was often closely related to the volume of catch; if there was no catch, there would not be any specimens collected. Many species had little to no data in Area 4B, but these species were either not found or had fishing closures in the Strait of Georgia. If these species did have a small amount of catch or specimens collected, they likely came from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait) and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait). In addition, for most species, the best specimen collection across all areas occurred pre-2005. In the case of rockfish, this trend could be linked to the reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) of some inshore stocks of up to 75\\% between 2002 and 2005 [@davis_evaluating_2008]. The representativeness of the data was also related to the volume of catch. A larger catch meant more specimens collected; therefore, the data collected would be more representative. Weight data were lacking for most species. Weights were often not collected, but if they were, they were mostly collected from sorted specimens in the 2000s. 

There was a discrepancy between what data were collected and what data could be used in stock assessments or other studies. Data from sorted specimens are not used in stock assessments; however, data from unsorted specimens is becoming less common. In addition, age structures were often collected, yet very few of them were aged. On average, fewer than half of the collected age structures were analyzed. 

In conclusion, we stopped receiving biological data from commercial fishing vessels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, commercial specimen collection had already greatly declined since peaking in the early 2000s. Here, we displayed and summarized the data collected over the past 27 years, to inform future data collection programs.
