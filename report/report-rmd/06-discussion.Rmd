# Discussion

In this report, we summarized the available data collected from commercial fishing vessels by dockside samplers or at-sea observers from 1996 to 2022 for 29 groundfish species that are found off the coast of British Columbia. We presented the data for each species over 4 pages. The first page displayed the commercial catch and specimen collection for each year and area. Page two summarized the amounts and types of data that we have for that species. Page three indicates how representative the data were compared to the catch. The fourth page plotted the age and length frequency data, separated by sex, for each year and area. 

Of the 29 species included in this report, Pacific Hake had the best data coverage over time and space. Pacific Hake was only missing two years of sorted specimen data, and every area contained at least some, if not abundant, data. Pacific Ocean Perch (*Sebastes alutus*) also had near complete data coverage. Other species that had strong data coverage were Arrowtooth Flounder (*Atheresthes stomias*) and Yellowtail Rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*). Some species had consistent data across space and time, but the data were almost exclusively from sorted specimens (e.g., Pacific Halibut). No species had complete data coverage (i.e., data from every year in every area).

Longnose Skate (*Raja rhina*) and Shortraker Rockfish (*Sebastes borealis*) were the two most poorly sampled species in this report, with only seven or eight fishing events of data covering only three or four areas over the 27-year period, respectively. Big Skate (*Beringraja binoculata*) and Yelloweye Rockfish (*Sebastes ruberrimus*) were also poorly sampled. Yelloweye Rockfish were primarily caught by the hook and line fleet and biological sampling programs to complement the Electronic Monitoring have not yet been developed. Most commercial samples that do exist are a result of special projects undertaken by DFO Science and industry. 

Of the species included in this report, most species stopped being sampled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, for many species, unsorted data collection stopped before this time. On average, flatfish sorted sampling ended around 2017--2019, and unsorted sampling ended in 2015. Most rockfish continued to be sampled until 2020, but unsorted sampling stopped 2018 or earlier for some species. Round fish, such as Pacific Hake and Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*), had the most consistent coverage of data across time. Many species also exhibited a gap in sorted specimen collection in the late 2000s to early 2010s, lasting 1--7 years. If this gap occurred, usually unsorted specimen collection increased during that time.

The volume of collected specimens was often closely related to the volume of catch. Many species had little to no data in Area 4B, but these species are either not found or had fishing closures in the Strait of Georgia. If these species did have a small amount of catch or specimens collected in Area 4B, they usually came from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait) and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait). In addition, for most species, the best specimen collection across all areas occurred pre-2005, likely by dockside monitoring. In the case of rockfishes, this trend could be linked to the reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) of some inshore stocks of up to 75% between 2002 and 2005 [@davis_evaluating_2008]. Furthermore, the more specimens collected, the more representative the sampling was of the catch. Often, if sampling was not representative at the area level, it was representative when totaled across all areas. 

From 1996--2020, the vast majority of sampling occurred at-sea. The only species that had a greater proportion of samples come from dockside monitoring were Quillback Rockfish (*Sebastes maliger*), Shortraker Rockfish, and Yelloweye Rockfish. Since 2020, when the at-sea observer program ceased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only three species have commercial samples: Lingcod, Pacific Hake, and Sablefish. Lingcod and Sablefish samples were from at-sea, while Pacific Hake samples were a mix of both at-sea and dockside, but mostly from dockside. "At-sea" samples for this time period would be from samples that were randomly selected off the conveyor belt and bagged at-sea by the fishers, and were later sampled on shore by DFO or AMR staff.

Weight data are important in some stock assessments (in particular the Pacific Cod [*Gadus macrocephalus*] and Walley Pollock [*Theragra chalcogramma*]) assessments, which rely heavily on commercial mean-weight indices); however, weight data were lacking for most species. If weights were collected, they were mostly collected from sorted specimens in the 2000s, likely by dockside monitoring due to a lack of scales at sea. Sexed length data were also often missing for species that are easily sexed externally (i.e., sharks and skates).

There was a discrepancy between what data were collected and what data could be used in stock assessments or other studies. Data from sorted specimens are often not used in stock assessments; however, data from unsorted specimens are becoming less commonly collected. In addition, age structures were often collected, yet few of them were aged. On average, fewer than half of the collected age structures were analyzed.

Although, DFO stopped receiving biological data from commercial fishing vessels due to the COVID-19 pandemic, commercial specimen collection had already greatly declined since peaking in the early 2000s. Here, we displayed and summarized the data collected over the past 27 years, to inform future data collection programs.
