# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Biological data collected from commercial fishing vessels are an important component of fisheries stock assessments. In Canadaâ€™s Pacific region, these data have been collected by independent, third-party at-sea observers aboard commercial bottom trawl vessels, dockside monitoring programs, and special projects [@davis_evaluating_2008].

The at-sea observer program was launched in 1996, and required most commercial bottom trawl fishing vessels to fund and bring a third-party observer aboard to record catch and collect specimen data. There was 100% mandatory observer coverage for all vessels participating in the Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) groundfish trawl fishery under the Option "A" groundfish license. Bottom trawlers operating in the Strait of Georgia (Option "B" groundfish license) were excluded from this 100% requirement, as were mid-water Pacific Hake (*Merluccius productus*) trawlers [@haigh_at-sea_2002]. The hook and line fleet (Pacific Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*), Lingcod (*Ophiodon elongatus*), rockfish, and North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (*Squalus suckleyi*) and the Sablefish (*Anoplopoma fimbria*) trap fishery were also exempt from carrying at-sea observers 100% of the time. Electronic Monitoring was introduced in these fisheries in 2006, but systems to collect biological samples at-sea have not been developed [@stanley_design_2015]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all at-sea observer programs were paused and have not been re-introduced, having a profound effect on the volume and type of data received from commercial fishing vessels [@dfo_groundfish_2023]. The at-sea observer program was operated by Archipelago Marine Research Ltd (AMR) under contract to industry.

Biological data from commercial fishing vessels were also collected by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) dockside monitoring programs and special projects. Dockside biological sampling of the Pacific groundfish fishery has occurred since the late 1950s. Annual reports of these data have been published from 1970--1985 [@hamer_inventory_1986]. Dockside sampling occurred in Prince Rupert and Vancouver until 2010 and 2017, respectively. For a few species, commercial data were also collected during special projects. These special projects were studies completed jointly by DFO with industry participation. For example, two special projects on Yelloweye Rockfish took place from 1997--1998 [@kronlund_yelloweye_2001, @yamanaka_structure_2000]. Data from special projects are also available before 1996. For example, a study on two Pacific Ocean Perch stocks occurred from 1980--1993 [@leaman_experimental_1993].

This report was developed to provide an overview of data collection and availability from 1996--2022 for major BC groundfish species of commercial and conservation interest. Not all of the available data are presented. For example, sorted specimen data, from high-graded specimens, are often not used in stock assessments. Also, age structures are often not aged until a stock assessment is in preparation and are subject to capacity limits of the Sclerochronology Lab (SCL). This report can guide decisions on future monitoring programs, data collection, and resource allocation. The data are presented by year at a coastwide scale, and also by finer, Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) Areas (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)) so that the spatial and temporal trends can be assessed. 

The groundfish commercial bio-sampling report was modelled after the groundfish data synopsis [@anderson2019synopsis; @anderson2020fisheries; @dfo_data_2022]. Generation is automated---pulling data from government databases, generating visualizations, and stitching the document together. The figures are displayed by species and follow standardized layouts, similar to the groundfish data synopsis report. The main figures of the report are presented in four-page, species-by-species subsections that visually synthesize the available commercial data for each species. The report covers 29 groundfish species that have commercial catch quota. However, quota species with little to no data are not included because the lack of data is already illustrated in the groundfish data synopsis.  

The data are pulled from Groundfish databases using the [gfdata](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfdata) R package [@anderson2019synopsis; @gfdata]. The commercial catch data are pulled from the table `GF_MERGED_CATCH` in the GFFOS database using the `get_catch()` function. The commercial sample data are pulled from several tables in the GFBioSQL database using the `get_commercial_samples()` function. In addition, to determine whether a sample came from at-sea or dockside, we joined the column `FE_MAJOR_LEVEL_ID` (i.e., set number) from the B21_samples table to the existing commercial samples data by `FISHING_EVENT_ID`. An `FE_MAJOR_LEVEL_ID` code of 900 or 901, indicated that the specimen data were collected dockside.

Each set of pages for a single species is laid out in the same format. The page layout begins with the species common name, the species scientific name, the DFO species code, which usually corresponds to the page number referencing the species in @hart1988, the species Order and Family, links to the species FishBase and WoRMS pages, citations for the last Research Document, Last Science Advisory Report, and COSEWIC Status Report (if available), and the species COSEWIC and SARA status (if applicable). All of the figures display the data separated by PMFC areas and year (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)). The figures are laid out such that the first page has figures pertaining to the amount of catch and number of specimens collected. The second page has a plot containing the sorted and unsorted commercial specimen counts. Page three illustrates how representative the collected specimens are across space and time. Page four contains age and length frequency data. Detailed figure captions are included in Section \@ref(sec:plot-descriptions).
