abstract: |
 Biological data collected from commercial fishing vessels are an important component of fisheries stock assessments. In Canada’s Pacific region, these data have been collected by independent, third-party at-sea observers aboard commercial bottom trawl vessels, dockside monitoring programs, and special projects. However, the COVID-19 pandemic paused all at-sea observer programs and they have not been re-introduced, having a profound effect on the volume and type of data received from commercial fishing vessels. This report was developed to provide an overview of data collection and availability from 1996-2022 for major BC groundfish species of commercial and conservation interest. The data are presented at a coastwide scale, and also by finer, Groundfish Management Areas (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)) so that the spatial and temporal trends can be assessed. The goals of the report were to (1) display available data acquired from commercial fishing vessels, and (2) perform a basic qualitative analysis of the temporal and spatial trends of the data by species. This report highlights what data we are no longer collecting and can guide decisions on future monitoring programs, data collection, and resource allocation.
