arrowtooth flounder,"Arrowtooth Flounder were caught mostly by bottom trawl. The bulk of the catch came from Areas 5D, 5B, and 3D, with negligible catch in Areas 5C and 4B. The largest catch occurred in 2005, but the greatest number of specimens were collected in 2001. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2020, with gaps occurring from 2010-2015. Unsorted specimen collection ended in 2017, missing only 1997. By Area, representativeness of the sampling varies. Off the West Coast of Vancouver Island, in Area 3C the sampling represented the commercial catch in some years from 2000-2015. In Area 3D,  sampling was quite representative in most years from 1998-2018. Samples were somewhat representative in Area 5A from 1998-2007. Sampling was representative in 5B and mostly representative in 5D until 2018, except in 2008. Sampling in 5C and 5E was rarely representative of the catch. Many age structures were collected, but only 25\% or fewer were aged. Weight data were limited and stopped in 2017. Length data were abundant, and are mostly sexed. Sampling mostly occurred at-sea (95\%)."
big skate,"Big Skate were caught mostly by bottom trawl, but some by midwater trawl and hook and line. The catch and specimens mostly came from Areas 5D and 5B. The other areas had little, if negligible, catch. The largest catch and specimen collection occurred in 2003, both of which have since been steadily declining. Both sorted and unsorted specimen collection began in 2001. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2016, with gaps from 2006-2009 and 2013-2015. Unsorted specimen collection was consistent until ending in 2015. Sampling was moderately representative of the commercial catch in Area 5B from 2002-2007, excluding 2006. The sampling in the other areas was rarely representative of the catch. Sampling of Big Skate is limited to length sampling, and length data were mostly unsexed despite the ease of externally sexing skates. There are no age or weight data. Sampling mostly occurred at-sea (96\%)."
bocaccio,"Bocaccio were caught by bottom and midwater trawl, and occasionally by hook and line. The catch and specimens mostly came from Areas 5AB and 3CD. The other areas had negligible catch. There have been no reported trawl landings of Bocaccio from the Strait of Georgia since 1983.

The largest catch occurred in 2022, while specimen collection peaked in 1999, 2004, and 2019. Data collection was inconsistent across time and space. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1996-2020, with many years missing. Unsorted specimen collection occurred from 2004-2020, but missed 2012 and 2016-2019. The specimen collection was rarely representative of the catch. Almost all age structures collected were aged, and most lengths were from sexed individuals. Weight data were very limited. Sampling mostly occurred at-sea (86\%)."
canary rockfish,"Canary Rockfish were caught mostly by bottom trawl, but some by midwater trawl and hook and line. The area with the most catch and specimens collected was Area 3D.

english sole,"English Sole were caught mostly by bottom trawl, but some by midwater trawl. The vast majority of catch occurred in Area 5D, while catch in Area 5E was negligible. Catch remained relatively consistent over time, but has slowly decreased since 2005. Specimen collection also mostly came from Area 5D and peaked in 1998 before significantly decreasing. Area 4B had the second largest amount of catch, but due to the Option B bottom trawl fleet being exempt from carrying at-sea observers, almost no specimens were collected. Sorted specimen collected ended in 2019 with gaps from 2010-2012 and in 2014. Unsorted specimen collection was consistent until ending in 2015. Sampling was representative most years in Area 5D from 1996-2011. Sampling in the other areas was rarely representative.

lingcod,"Lingcod were caught by bottom trawl and hook and line, and a small portion by midwater trawl. The catch amounts were greatest in Areas 5AB and 3CD. Catch in Area 4B was very low and would have only come from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait)  and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) as the commercial fishery in the Strait of Georgia has been closed since 1990 [@holt2016lingSOG]. Catch from the hook and line fishery remained relatively consistent over time, but the trawl fishery catch has slowly decreased since 2000. Specimen collection peaked in 2002, then drastically decreased. Area 5B had the highest volume of collected specimens. Specimens were collected exclusively from bottom trawl.

Sampling mostly occurred at-sea (56\%)."
longnose skate,"Longnose Skate were caught by bottom trawl and hook and line. Marginally more catch came from Area 3C, but the catch was otherwise fairly evenly spread across the outside areas. Area 4B had very little catch. Specimen collection was very sparce, and from bottom trawl only. Specimens were only collected in Areas 5D, 5B, and 3CD. Half of the data came from sorted specimens, while the other half came from unsorted specimens. Due to low sampling effort, sampling was not representative of the catch. There were no age or weight data. Length data were only from unsexed individuals, despite the ease of sexing skates externally. All sampling occurred at-sea (100\%)."
longspine thornyhead,"Longspine Thornyhead were caught mostly by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection followed a similar trajectory. They peaked around 2000, then steadily decreased until 2007 after which levels remained low. Both Catch and specimen collection were most abundant in Area 3D.

In Areas 5AB, sampling was moderately representative from 2000-2004. Sampling in Area 3C was representative from 1998-2009. The 1996 age data are not plotted because the samples were designated as unusable [@anderson2019synopsis]. Weight data were only collected in 2001. Most of the length data were sexed. The commercial otoliths collected have not been aged because the SCL has not been able to reliably age research specimens, as is often the case with deep-sea species. All sampling occurred at-sea (100\%)."
north pacific spiny dogfish,"North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were caught mostly by hook and line, but with some catch by bottom and midwater trawl. The majority of the catch came from Areas 3CD and 4B.
