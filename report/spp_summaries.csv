arrowtooth flounder,"Arrowtooth Flounder were caught mostly by bottom trawl. Most of the catch came from Areas 5D, 5B, and 3D, with negligible catch in Area 4B. The largest catch occurred in 2005, but the largest specimen collection was in 2001. Unsorted specimen collection ended in 2017, lacking data from only 1997. Sorted specimen collection occurred from 1997 to 2020, with several small gaps from 2010 to 2015. Nearly all unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. All samples that lacked spatial coordinates were collected between 2009 and 2011. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched in most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2001 to 2015. Area 5B had the most representative sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 35256 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 17477 (50%) had age structures, and 3098 (9% of specimens; 18% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 18470 (52%) were sexed, while 340 (1%) had weights."
big skate,"Big Skate were primarily caught by bottom trawl, but some were caught by midwater trawl and hook and line. The catch and specimen collection mainly occurred in Areas 5D and 5B.

Area 5B had the most representative sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 6850 unsorted specimens were collected, and none had age structures. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 58 (1%) were sexed, and none had weights."
bocaccio,"Bocaccio were caught by bottom and midwater trawl and occasionally by hook and line. The catch and specimen collection mainly occurred in Areas 5AB and 3CD. Area 4B had negligible catch. There have been no reported trawl landings of Bocaccio from the Strait of Georgia since 1983. Any catch in 4B came from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait) and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) (Figure \@ref(fig: minor-area-map)) [@cosewic2002bocaccio]. The largest catch occurred in 2022, while specimen collection peaked in 1999, 2004, and 2019. Unsorted specimen collection occurred from 2004 to 2020 but had gaps in 2012 and 2016 to 2019.

lingcod,"Lingcod were caught by bottom trawl, hook and line, and occasionally by midwater trawl. The catch was slightly higher in Areas 5AB and 3CD. Catch in Area 4B was low and would have only come from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait)  and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) (Figure \@ref(fig: minor-area-map)) as the commercial fishery in the Strait of Georgia has been closed since 1990 [@holt2016lingSOG]. Catch from the hook and line fishery remained relatively consistent from 2001 to 2022. The trawl fishery catch decreased from 2004 to 2020 but slightly increased from 2021 to 2022. Specimen collection was variable from 2000 to 2004 and remained low from 2005 onward. Nearly all specimens were collected from the bottom trawl fishery. Unsorted specimen collection occurred only from 1996 to 2004, missing 1997. Sorted specimens were collected consistently until 2010. Nearly all unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. All samples lacking spatial coordinates were collected in Area 5A in 1996. Cumulative total sampling tended to be variable relative to the cumulative total catch in all years with biological sampling.

longnose skate,"Longnose Skate were mostly caught by bottom trawl and hook and line. The catch was slightly higher in Area 3C than in the other areas. Specimen collection was sparse and from bottom trawl only. Specimens were only collected in Areas 5D, 5B, and 3CD. Half of the specimens were unsorted, and the other half were sorted. All unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling tended to lead cumulative total catch in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 175 unsorted specimens were collected, but none had age structures. All unsorted specimens had lengths, but none were sexed or had weights."
longspine thornyhead,"Longspine Thornyhead were mostly caught by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection were highest in Area 3D. The catch was negligible in Areas 5C and 4B. Catch peaked in 1999, while specimen collection peaked in 2001. Both declined until 2005 and remained low after 2007. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently from 1997 to 2018, only missing 2016. Sorted specimen collection occurred until 2018, with several gaps from 2004 to 2015. All unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2000 to 2012. Between 1996 and 2022, 198013 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 34488 (17%) had age structures, but none were aged. Challenges in ageing otoliths, as often encountered for deep-sea species and confirmed by the SCL on research specimens, led to the choice not to age commercial otoliths. All unsorted specimens had lengths, and of these, 29916 (15%) were sexed, while 50 (<1%) had weights. The dominant length type was total length, but fork length measurements were also collected. We replaced the age frequency plot with a second length-frequency plot for fork lengths."
pacific cod,"Pacific Cod were caught mostly by bottom trawl. Catch and specimen collection was highest in Area 5D. Areas 5E and 4B had very little catch. Total catch fluctuated over the years, peaking in 1997, 2005, and 2010. Specimen collection similarly peaked in 1998, 2004, and 2010. No specimens were collected from Area 4B. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently until 2017. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2019, missing only 2015. All unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2002 to 2015. Between 1996 and 2022, 122475 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 394 (<1%) had age structures, and 25 (<1% of specimens; 6% of age structures) were aged. Ageing methods for Pacific Cod have so far been deemed unreliable [@chilton1982age], so they were rarely collected and only aged one year. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 1758 (1%) were sexed, while 1024 (1%) had weights. However, the current Pacific Cod assessment relies heavily on a commercial mean-weight index."
pacific hake,"Pacific Hake were caught mostly by midwater trawl. The catch and specimen collection was highest in Area 3C. Total catch fluctuated over time, peaking around 1996, 2004, and 2018. Except for 2004, total specimen collection has decreased since 1996. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently over the 27 years. Sorted specimen collection occurred in all years except 2014 and 2015. Very few of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched most of the years with biological sampling, particularly from 2004 to 2015. Between 1996 and 2022, 520246 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 137503 (26%) had age structures, and 25081 (5% of specimens; 18% of age structures) were aged. The SCL ages commercial otoliths regularly for the annual stock assessment work done jointly by DFO and NOAA. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 507029 (97%) were sexed, while 22891 (4%) had weights."
pacific halibut,"Pacific Halibut were caught mostly by hook and line. The catch mainly occurred in the northern areas. The catch in Area 4B was low and would have only come from minor areas 12 (Queen Charlotte Strait) and 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait) (Figure \@ref(fig: minor-area-map)). The catch peaked in 2006 and has since slowly decreased. Specimen collection peaked in 2002 and mostly came from 'discarded' specimens. The bottom trawl fleet is not allowed to retain Pacific Halibut, but must measure them for quota management. Sorted specimens were collected consistently from 1999 to 2020, while unsorted specimen collection was limited.  Sampling was reduced starting in 2020 when the ASOP stopped sampling on bottom trawl vessels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very few of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. All the samples with spatial coordinates were collected in Area 5E in 2003. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles did not match in the years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 208 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 1 (<1%) had age structures, but none were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 64 (31%) were sexed, while 142 (68%) had weights."
pacific ocean perch,"Pacific Ocean Perch were primarily caught by bottom trawl and occasionally by midwater trawl. Areas 5E and 5B had the highest catch. The catch in Area 4B was negligible.

Unsorted specimen collection ended in 2016 and was missing in 2005, 2007, and 2008. Sorted specimen collection ended in 2019 and was missing in 1997, 2012, and 2015. Roughly half of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Most of the samples that lacked spatial coordinates were collected in Areas 4B and 3C from 2009 to 2013 and 1996 to 2001, respectively. Cumulative total sampling tended to be variable relative to cumulative total catch in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 35449 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 320 (1%) had age structures, but none were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 21934 (62%) were sexed, but none had weights. Since there were no age data to plot, we replaced the age frequency plot with a second length-frequency plot for fork lengths."
petrale sole,"Petrale Sole were caught mostly by bottom trawl. The catch was highest in Area 3C, while the catch in Area 4B was negligible. The catch slowly increased until 2011, slowly decreased until 2020, then increased again until 2022. Specimen collection peaked in 1999, then decreased until 2003.

Unsorted specimen samples were historically abundant, but sample sizes have been low recently, especially from the hook and line and trawl fisheries. The sampling method differed among gear types. Trawl catch was sampled as part of the ASOP (1996--2020). Trap and hook and line fisheries have been sampled by a voluntary commercial catch sampling program since 1995 [@haist2001sablefish]. Under the voluntary program, samples are collected and frozen at sea by a fishing crew and brought back to shore for biological sampling. Before 2018, samples of whole fish were frozen. Starting in 2018, a head-only sampling program was initiated [@lacko2023sablefish_head]."

Roughly half of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. All samples that included spatial coordinates were collected between 1999 and 2000. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles did not match, which is consistent with low sampling representativeness. Between 1996 and 2022, 1640 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 814 (50%) had age structures, and 633 (39% of specimens; 78% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 1126 (69%) were sexed, while 958 (58%) had weights."
yellowmouth rockfish,"Yellowmouth Rockfish were mostly caught by bottom trawl, with some by midwater trawl. Catch and specimen collection was highest in Areas 5AB. Catch remained stable from 1996 to 2005, then decreased until 2008 before stabilizing again. Specimen collection peaked suddenly in 1998, then decreased quickly after 2000. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently until 2018. Sorted specimen collection occurred until 2019, with a large gap from 2010 to 2015. Nearly all of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Most samples lacking spatial coordinates were collected in 1996, 2000, and between 2008 and 2017. Cumulative total sampling profiles tended to match or be variable to cumulative total catch profiles in most years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 12860 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 7421 (58%) had age structures, and 3142 (24% of specimens; 42% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 7752 (60%) were sexed, while 938 (7%) had weights."
yellowtail rockfish,"Yellowtail Rockfish were mostly caught by bottom and midwater trawl. Catch and specimen collection was highest in Area 3D. The catch remained stable over time. Specimen collection peaked in 1999 before quickly decreasing. Unsorted specimens were collected consistently until 2018. Sorted specimen collection occurred until 2018, with a gap from 2014 to 2015. Roughly half of the unsorted samples had latitude and longitude data. Samples that lacked spatial coordinates were collected in most years with biological sampling. Cumulative total sampling and catch profiles matched in roughly half of the years with biological sampling. Between 1996 and 2022, 30506 unsorted specimens were collected, and of these, 22832 (75%) had age structures, and 9685 (32% of specimens; 42% of age structures) were aged. All unsorted specimens had lengths; of these, 23480 (77%) were sexed, while 1548 (5%) had weights."
